# Universal API Translator v0.01 Release

We're thrilled to announce the first release of Universal API Translator! This powerful tool leverages AI to seamlessly convert between different API formats, saving developers countless hours of manual work.

## What's New

### AI-Powered Conversion
Our intelligent conversion engine understands the semantics of your API specifications and translates them accurately across formats:

- **OpenAPI to GraphQL**: Convert REST APIs to GraphQL schemas
- **SOAP to REST**: Modernize legacy SOAP services
- **gRPC to OpenAPI**: Generate REST documentation from gRPC
- **And more**: Support for multiple API formats

### Monaco Editor Integration
We've integrated the Monaco Editor (the same editor that powers VS Code) for a familiar, powerful editing experience:

```typescript
const translator = new Translator({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

const result = await translator.convert({
  from: 'openapi',
  to: 'graphql',
  spec: openApiSpec
});
```

### SDK Generation
Automatically generate client SDKs in multiple languages:

- Node.js / TypeScript
- Python
- Go
- Java
- C#

### Real-Time Preview
See your translations instantly with our split-pane editor. Make changes on the left, see results on the right.
