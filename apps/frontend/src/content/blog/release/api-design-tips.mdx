# 5 Tips for Better API Design

Great API design is both an art and a science. Here are five essential tips to help you create APIs that developers will love.

## 1. Use Consistent Naming Conventions

Consistency is key to a good developer experience. Choose a naming convention and stick to it throughout your API.

### Resource Names

Use plural nouns for collections:

```
✅ GET /users
✅ GET /products
❌ GET /user
❌ GET /product
```

### Field Names

Choose either camelCase or snake_case and be consistent:

```json
// ✅ Consistent camelCase
{
  "userId": "123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-25"
}

// ❌ Mixed conventions
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "created_at": "2024-01-25"
}
```

## 2. Version Your API

Always version your API from day one. This allows you to make breaking changes without disrupting existing clients.

### URL Versioning

```
GET /v1/users
GET /v2/users
```

### Header Versioning

```http
GET /users
Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json
```

## 3. Provide Meaningful Error Messages

Good error messages help developers debug issues quickly.

### Bad Error

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid request"
}
```

### Good Error

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Email address is required",
    "field": "email",
    "details": "The email field cannot be empty"
  }
}
```

## 4. Implement Proper Pagination

For endpoints that return lists, always implement pagination to prevent performance issues.

### Cursor-Based Pagination

```javascript
GET /users?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ&limit=20

{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "nextCursor": "eyJpZCI6MTQzfQ",
    "hasMore": true
  }
}
```

### Offset-Based Pagination

```javascript
GET /users?offset=0&limit=20

{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 150
  }
}
```

## 5. Document Everything

Comprehensive documentation is crucial for API adoption.

### What to Document

- **Authentication**: How to authenticate requests
- **Endpoints**: All available endpoints and their parameters
- **Examples**: Real-world usage examples
- **Error Codes**: All possible error responses
- **Rate Limits**: Usage limits and quotas

### Use OpenAPI

OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) provides a standard way to document APIs:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: My API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: List all users
      parameters:
        - name: limit
          in: query
          schema:
            type: integer
            default: 20
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
```

## Bonus Tip: Use Universal API Translator

Once you have your API designed, use Universal API Translator to:

- Convert between formats (OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Generate client SDKs
- Validate your specifications
- Maintain consistency across versions

## Conclusion

Good API design takes practice, but following these tips will set you on the right path. Remember:

1. Be consistent
2. Version early
3. Provide clear errors
4. Implement pagination
5. Document thoroughly

Your developers will thank you!
