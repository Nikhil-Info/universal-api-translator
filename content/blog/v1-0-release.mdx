# Universal API Translator v1.0 Release

We're excited to announce the first stable release of Universal API Translator!

## What's New

### AI-Powered Conversion

Our new AI engine can intelligently convert between API formats with unprecedented accuracy.

```typescript
// Example: Converting OpenAPI to GraphQL
const result = await translator.convert({
  from: 'openapi',
  to: 'graphql',
  spec: openApiSpec
});
```

### SDK Generation

Generate production-ready SDKs in multiple languages:

- Node.js / TypeScript
- Python
- Go
- Java
- C#

### Improved Performance

We've optimized the translation engine for 3x faster conversions.

## Breaking Changes

None! This is our first stable release.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install @universal-api/translator
```
